    <h2>Basics</h2>

    <p>
      Saturday Night Live is one of the longest running primetime shows in the U.S. Across 41 seasons it has had 808 episodes featuring 143 different cast members.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cast members on Saturday Night have one of two[0] types of roles, repertory players and featured players. What's the difference? Repertory players are the main, typically veteran, cast members while featured players have to prove their chops. For the first twenty-one seasons, some cast members started out as repertory players while others started as featured players. Starting with season 22, new cast members always begin as featured players.

    <h2>Seasons</h2>

    <p>
      Across 41 seasons, the cast of SNL has had freqent changes, not only in the active cast members, but also in how many of them there are.
    </p>

    <div id="season-casts"></div>
    <p>
      As the casts change, so does the level of experience. While for the first twenty-two seasons most casts averaged less than two seasons of experience per cast member, the last nineteen seasons have seen an average of over three seasons experience per cast member.
    </p>
    <div id="season-experience"></div>
    <p>
      Season 33 had the most experienced cast of any season. This is due to a mixture of seasoned veterans and the lack of newcomers, with only one SNL rookie that season.
    </p>
    <div id="season-most-experienced"></div>
    <p>
      Saturday Night Live has always had a male dominated cast. While the ratio of male to female cast members has fluctuated, it has certainly improved, albeit slowly, from its 81% male cast in season 16.
    </p>
    <div id="season-genders"></div>
    <div id="season-gender-percents"></div>
    <p>
      The ratio of repertory players to featured players has varied dramatically throughout the seasons.

    <h2>Individual Statistics</h2>
    <p>
      Cast members come from a variety of backgrounds. Some join while young, others while middle aged, but most during their late twenties and early thirties. The only requirement is that they are funny.
    </p>

    <div id="starting-ages">
      <h3>Starting Ages</h3>
      <div id="starting-age-table"></div>
      <div id="starting-age"></div>
      <p>
        Male cast members have two peak ages for joining, 25-26 and 31. Female cast members meanwhile peak from 27-28.
      </p>
      <div id="starting-age-gender"></div>
      <div id="starting-age-normalized"></div>
      <div id="starting-age-season-gender"></div>
      <p>
        This chart doesn't provide a lot of information. The one interesting thing is that you can see is that after season 22 all new cast members join as featured players.
      </p>
      <div id="starting-age-season-role"></div>
    </div>

    <div id="cast-member-credits">
      <h3>Credits</h3>
      <p>
        Over one third of the cast members have only lasted one season on the show.
      </p>
      <div id="total-seasons"></div>
      <p>
        While more female cast members (by percent) leave with only one season of experience, the ones that do last tend to stay longer than male cast members.
      </p>
      <div id="gender-seasons"></div>
      <div id="total-credits"></div>
      <div id="gender-credits"></div>
      <p>
        Looking at the starting ages of cast members plotted against the number of seasons they left the show after shows no strong correlation.
      </p>
      <div id="seasons-vs-start-age"></div>
      <div id="credits-vs-start-age"></div>
    </div>

    <div id="ending-ages">
      <h3>Ending Ages[1]</h3>
      <p>
        To state the obvious, when cast members leave the show, they are older than they were when they started. How much? Cast members on average stay for three seasons, so about three years older.
      </p>
      <p>
        This data only includes cast members who have left the show.

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
      [0] - Seasons 16-18 had a third role, "Also Starring", but because of its short run, actors who were "Also Starring" are considered "Featured Players" here.
    </p>
    <p>
      [1] - Cast members who have not yet left the show are not included in these charts.
