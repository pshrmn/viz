    <p>
      Saturday Night Live is one of the longest running primetime shows in the U.S. Across 41 seasons it has had 808 episodes featuring 143 different cast members.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cast members on Saturday Night have one of two[0] types of roles, repertory players and featured players. What's the difference? Repertory players are the main, typically veteran, cast members while featured players have to prove their chops. For the first twenty-one seasons, some cast members started out as repertory players while others started as featured players. Starting with season 22, new cast members always begin as featured players.
