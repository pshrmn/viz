  <h1>Planet Scale</h1>

  <section>
    <p>
      Our planetary system is made up of one star, eight planets, a handful of dwarf planets, and numerous other debris following Newton's laws of motion. Eight planets in our planetary system. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are their names.

    <p>
      Of course, they are not all the same size.
    </p>
    <div id="scale-planets" class="example"></div>
    <p>
      Nor are they equally separated.
    </p>
    <div id="distance-planets" class="example"></div>
    <p>
      Shrinking them down to size with respect to distance would result in a blank drawing. While Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, has an impressive sounding 57 million kilometer average distance from the Sun, it is a short hop when compared to the 4.5 billion kilometers away from the Sun you must travel to reach Neptune.

    <p>
      So how big are the planets when they are scaled for distance? Let's take a look at our planet, Earth, alongside the Moon. Compared to the other planets, the Moon is a measly 384,400 kilometers away.
    </p>
    <div id="earth-to-moon" class="example"></div>
    <p>
      The closest that another planet, Venus, gets to Earth is about 38 million kilometers. That is two orders of magnitude larger than the example above.
