      The Earth is quite a large place. The odds are that you are currently located on it. If not, then you must be among the lucky few currently orbiting the planet. (If you are not in the vicinity of Earth, please feel free to contact the author in order to issue a correction)

      The radius of the Earth from its center to the North and South Poles is approximately 6,357 kilometers. From the center of the Earth to the surface of the planet along the equator, the radius is about 6,378 kilometers. This difference in radii is caused by the rotation of the planet and other factors. Technically speaking, this makes Earth an oblate spheroid, not a sphere. However, because the difference between the radii is so small (~0.3%), it is hardly noticeable for the Earth to be drawn as a sphere instead. The mean radius of Earth has been measured to be 6,371 kilometers.

      Using these radius values, we can calculate that the circumference of the equator of Earth is 40,074 kilometers while the mean circumference is 40,030 kilometers. If these numbers seems surprisingly close to 40,000 to you, it isn't a coincidence. The meter was created as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. Multiply that by four (because the equator to the North Pole is 1/4th of the circumference of the Eath) and convert to kilometers and you get 40,000.

      Those distances are long, but that shouldn't be surprising. After all, as said above, Earth is quite a large place. Perhaps it is best to look elsewhere in our planetary system to get a better idea of how large the Earth is. The first stop on our journey is the Moon.

    <h2>The Moon</h2>
    <p>
      Compared to the Earth, the Moon is rather small. Its mean radius is 1,737 kilometers and its mean circumference is 10,914 kilometers. Earth certainly seems quite large compared to the Moon.
