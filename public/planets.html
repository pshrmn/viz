  <h1>Planet Scale</h1>

  <section id="earth">
    <h2>Earth</h2>
    <p>
      The Earth is quite a large place. The Earth's radius is about 6,371 kilometers. 6,371 kilometers is slightly less than the distance from New York City to Berlin. Earth's circumference is approximately 40,030 kilometers. The current 100 meter sprint record is 9.58 seconds, set by Usain Bolt, which if he were to be moving at a constant velocity would be 10.44 meters per second. If he were to travel around the Earth at this rate, it would take him 44 days 9 hours 14 minutes and 34 seconds to complete one lap.

        While the Earth appears to be a sphere, it is actually an oblate spheroid. This means that the radius from the center of the planet to a point along the Equator (~6,378 km) is larger than the radius from the center of the planet to the North and South Poles (~6,357 km). This difference is caused by a number of factors including the rotation of the planet. However, because the difference between the radii is so small (~0.3%), it is difficult to differentiate a sphere from an oblate spheroid when they are drawn on a small scale. Because the difference is so little, the Earth and any other truly oblate spheroid objects will be drawn as spheres and assume a constant radius.

  <section id="moon">
    <h2>The Moon</h2>
    <p>
      Compared to the Earth, the Moon is rather small. Its mean radius is 1,737 kilometers and its mean circumference is 10,914 kilometers. Earth certainly seems quite large compared to the Moon.
    </p>
    <div id="earth-and-moon" class="example"></div>
    <p>
      The size of the Moon might not compare well to the Earth, but it is an impressive 384,400 kilometers from Earth. That is 9.6 times the circumference of the Earth and would take Usain Bolt 1 year 61 days 5 hours 18 minutes and 40 seconds to cover this distance moving at his world record setting pace.
